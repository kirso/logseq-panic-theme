- Using bright pink to differentiate internal and external links (feel free to change it in the `custom.css` to your liking)

## Usage

You can add the following line (above everything else) to your local directory where `custom.css` lives.

```css
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sokirill/logseq-panic-theme@latest/custom.css');
```

Or, just download / copy the code and paste it into your logseq CSS configuration file

## Issues

This is an early iteration of the theme and there probably are several issues whilst running it. If you face any bugs or problems kindly:

- Open an issue ticket [here](https://github.com/sokirill/logseq-panic-theme/issues/new). Don't forget to include a description and screenshot/video.
- Optionally, you can ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sokirill)

## Bullet threading

If you don't want bullet threading in the theme, just delete the code in `custom.css` with the following comment:

```css
/* Bullet threading*/
```
