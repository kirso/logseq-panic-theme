npm rebuild [[<@scope>/]<name>[@<version>] \.\.\.]

.RE
.SS Description
.P
This command runs the \fBnpm build\fP command on the matched folders\.  This is
useful when you install a new version of node, and must recompile all your
C++ addons with the new binary\.  It is also useful when installing with
\fB\-\-ignore\-scripts\fP and \fB\-\-no\-bin\-links\fP, to explicitly choose which
packages to build and/or link bins\.
.P
If one or more package names (and optionally version ranges) are provided,
then only packages with a name and version matching one of the specifiers
will be rebuilt\.

.SS \fBglobal\fP

.IP \(bu 2
Default: false
.IP \(bu 2
Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
Operates in "global" mode, so that packages are installed into the \fBprefix\fP
folder instead of the current working directory\. See
npm help folders for more on the differences in behavior\.
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
packages are installed into the \fB{prefix}/lib/node_modules\fP folder, instead
of the current working directory\.
.IP \(bu 2
bin files are linked to \fB{prefix}/bin\fP
.IP \(bu 2
man pages are linked to \fB{prefix}/share/man\fP

Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
Tells npm to create symlinks (or \fB\|\.cmd\fP shims on Windows) for package
executables\.
.P
Set to false to have it not do this\. This can be used to work around the
fact that some file systems don't support symlinks, even on ostensibly Unix
systems\.

.SS \fBignore\-scripts\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: false
.IP \(bu 2
Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package\.json files\.
.P
Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
\fBnpm start\fP, \fBnpm stop\fP, \fBnpm restart\fP, \fBnpm test\fP, and \fBnpm run\-script\fP
will still run their intended script if \fBignore\-scripts\fP is set, but they
will \fInot\fR run any pre\- or post\-scripts\.

Default:
.IP \(bu 2
Type: String (can be set multiple times)

.RE
.P
Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option\.
.P
Valid values for the \fBworkspace\fP config are either:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Workspace names
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a workspace directory
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a parent workspace directory (will result to selecting all of the
nested workspaces)

.RE
.P
When set for the \fBnpm init\fP command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project\.
.P
This value is not exported to the environment for child processes\.
